The utilization of robots can be very beneficial for elderly and disabled people's assistance as they can help them to regain autonomy to perform activities of daily living otherwise unachievable. In recent years, many studies have been made on Assistive Robotic Manipulators. However, a fully autonomous system that can adapt in real-time to the users' behavior and the surrounding environment is still yet to be accomplished. 

To work towards this goal, in this thesis we aim to go beyond standard control techniques and use the Model Predictive Control method for robotic manipulation, more specifically for a six-degrees of freedom robotic manipulator that is used for assistive purposes. MPC does not require any user's control input, allows the handle of nonlinear constraints, and opens the door for the integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques, contributing to a more autonomous assistance. The results show the ability to reach the reference position, even if it is variable through time, and to react immediately to perturbations, adapting the trajectory of the end-effector.
